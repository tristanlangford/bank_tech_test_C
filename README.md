### Bank Tech Test - C#

A small project designed to highlight my code quality and process. [source](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/individual_challenges/bank_tech_test.md)

I have also completed this tech test in [Node.js](https://github.com/tristanlangford/bank_tech_test) and [Ruby](https://github.com/tristanlangford/bank_tech_test_ruby).

It allows you to create an account, deposit, withdraw, and print statements.
